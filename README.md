**Introduction**

The paper introduces SmCCNet 2.0, an advanced tool for the integration of multi-omics data with a focus on phenotype-specific network analysis. Leveraging Sparse multiple canonical correlation network analysis (SmCCNet), this second-generation tool adeptly handles both single and multiple omics data types alongside quantitative or binary phenotypes. It enhances the practical utility by offering a streamlined, flexible setup and automates the entire pipeline, significantly boosting user-friendliness and computational efficiency. Key features include automated data preprocessing, robust network analysis with hierarchical clustering, subnetwork pruning, and an innovative RShiny application for detailed network visualization.
