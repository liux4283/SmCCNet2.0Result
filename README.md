**Introduction**

The paper introduces SmCCNet 2.0, an advanced tool for the integration of multi-omics data with a focus on phenotype-specific network analysis. Leveraging Sparse multiple canonical correlation network analysis (SmCCNet), this second-generation tool adeptly handles both single and multiple omics data types alongside quantitative or binary phenotypes. It enhances the practical utility by offering a streamlined, flexible setup and automates the entire pipeline, significantly boosting user-friendliness and computational efficiency. Key features include automated data preprocessing, robust network analysis with hierarchical clustering, subnetwork pruning, and an innovative RShiny application for detailed network visualization.

**Overview**

This repository hosts all the essential components used and presented in the manuscript of SmCCNet 2.0. It includes:

- **Subnetwork Results (Subnetworks folder)**: All subnetwork results (.Rdata metadata, network visualization, and more) discussed in the manuscript are stored here for reference and further analysis, all results are run based on SmCCNet 2.0.1.
- **Source Code of the Shiny Application (ShinyApp folder)**: The complete source code for the RShiny application used for network visualization is available, allowing users to explore and modify the visualization tool.
- **Source Package (Package folder)**: The full R package for SmCCNet 2.0.1, which includes functions for network analysis, data preprocessing, and integration of multi-omics data.
- **TCGA Breast Cancer Data (Data folder)**: The dataset used in the examples provided in the manuscript, is available in CSV format, enabling users to replicate the study results or conduct their analyses.
